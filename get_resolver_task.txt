Descriptive Instructions:
Adding Logging to get_resolver and Updating Calls
Objective:
Add logging functionality to the get_resolver function through a boolean parameter and update all calls to get_resolver to have the log parameter set to True, except for in the Django tests, where logging should be set to False.

Instructions:

Modify the get_resolver function:

Open the file where the get_resolver function is defined (django/urls/resolvers.py).
Add a new boolean parameter, log, to the function signature with a default value of False.
Inside the function body, implement the logging functionality that executes if log is True.

Update all calls to get_resolver:

Locate all files in your project that call get_resolver.
Update each call to include the log parameter set to True.

Exclude logging in Django tests:

Identify all test files in the Django project (commonly located in directories like tests, test, or under apps with tests modules).
Update the calls to get_resolver in these test files to set the log parameter to False.
